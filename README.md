This is JDBC CRUD application it is a software application that uses the JDBC API to perform basic database operations like Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). This type of application serves as a fundamental example of how to interact with a relational database system using Java programming

The JDBC CRUD application allows you to manage data stored in a database by executing corresponding SQL statements through the JDBC API. The CRUD operations correspond to the following actions:

1. Create (Insert):
This operation adding new records to the database. It uses the SQL 'INSERT' statement to insert data into a specified table.

2. Read (Retrieve):
The Read operation is about fetching data from the database. It uses the SQL 'SELECT' statement to retrieve data based on specific conditions.

3. Update:
The Update operation modifies existing records in the database. It uses the SQL 'UPDATE' statement to modify the data in a table.

4. Delete:
The Delete operation removes records from the database. It uses the SQL 'DELETE' statement to delete data from a table.

The JDBC CRUD application typically consists of the following components:

1. Database Connection:
Establishing a connection to the database system you're working with, using appropriate JDBC drivers and connection URLs.

2. Data Access Layer:
Implementing Java classes that handle the CRUD operations. This layer includes methods to execute SQL statements and manage the data interaction with the database.
